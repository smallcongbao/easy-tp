# easy tp
A MCDReforged Plugin about transport item and people

When I was playing mc with my friends in my own fabric server, 
they always ask me for giving them the permission of the tp. 
But the vanilla mc puts the permission of the tp to a person and an exact point together.
Some of them just use tp to an exact point frequently to have a fast adventure when I'm offline or some other situation.
That makes the others and me feel annoyed. So I write this plugin to solve this conflict.

Command:

'''
!!etp tp <player id> # ask for tp to the <player id>
'''
